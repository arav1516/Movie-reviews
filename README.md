This is a full stack web development project made in the form of a movie site that can be hosted through replit.
The frontend is made with the help of the html,css and javascript. Also an API from the THE-MOVIE-DATABASE(TMDB) 
API, is used in order to get the text and the pictures of the movies displayed on the web page.
The backend is made with the help of javascript and I have integrated the backend with mongodb which serves as
the database that can hold the reviews given by users on different movies on the website.

This is an ongoing project in which I am trying to get a proper login portal along with proper description of movies
on movie's personal page.
